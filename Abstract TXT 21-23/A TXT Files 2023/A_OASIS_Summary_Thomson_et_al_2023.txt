This quasi-experimental study investigated the extent to which explicit classroom intervention helped English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students in Japan to use multi-word expressions (MWEs) fluently in conversation. Over six weeks, an experimental group (n = 65) was encouraged to notice, practise, and produce 30 MWEs (e.g., I think I will, would you like to) through fluency workshop activities including shadowing, dictogloss and role-play. A control group (n = 51) followed normal linked skills classes without any planned exposure to the MWEs. Results showed increases in written production of MWEs in a cued recall test and in the use of MWEs in self-generated conversation. Both effects were significantly stronger for the experimental group than for the control group, and participants with higher vocabulary scores showed greater uptake of MWEs in the cued recall test. Individual differences in rate of MWE use did not predict fluency, as measured through speech rate, phonation time ratio and mean length of run. Teaching implications for promoting uptake of MWEs among language learners include explicit noticing and encouraging use of MWEs through a variety of classroom activities such as role-play.
