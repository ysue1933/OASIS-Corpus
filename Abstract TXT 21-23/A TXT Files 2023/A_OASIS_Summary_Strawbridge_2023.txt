This study utilizes social network analysis to characterize a typology of study abroad sojourner experience, detailing the relationship of social experience types to second language (L2) proficiency growth and study abroad program design. In contrast with previous research, the study performs a quantitative analysis of structural and compositional network features to identify a typology of social networks. Participants were 30 L2 Spanish learners from five US-based semester-long university study abroad programs in Spain. Social network data were collected using a social network questionnaire, while L2 development was measured through an elicited imitation task. Results identify four prominent social network patterns, characterized by varying levels of Spanish language use, emotional proximity to contacts, frequency of interaction, contact status as program peer or host community member, and network cohesion. L2 proficiency development was significantly affected by these patterns, which were shaped by the contrasting curricular models of study abroad programs.
