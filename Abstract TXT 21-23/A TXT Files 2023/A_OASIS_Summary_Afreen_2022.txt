Although a range of studies suggest that translation is a valuable pedagogical tool for language learning, the process of translation has not been adequately investigated. Further, the identity of the translator is invisible in much research on translation. To address these gaps in the field, the author draws on a self-study of her translation of English books into Bangla and uses narrative inquiry methods to investigate the process of translation and the negotiation of identity. Drawing its theoretical underpinnings from Norton’s work on identity (Darvin & Norton, 2015; Norton, 2013), the author investigates how she navigated her translator identity with respect to investment, capital, and ideology. Extending Nida’s formal and functional equivalence in translation (Nida & de Waard, 1986), the author develops a “continuum of equivalence” model to facilitate decision-making in the translation process and illustrates how she used this model in her English-Bangla translations. Drawing on her study, the author makes the case that the model could enhance the use of translation as a pedagogical tool to promote language learners’ critical language awareness, multicultural knowledge, and creative thinking. Further, her study makes visible the identity of the translator, an important stakeholder in the promotion of multilingualism in language education internationally.
