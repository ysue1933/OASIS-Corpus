Employing a mixed methods approach, this study investigated the mediating effect of negative emotion intensity on the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) and the emotion regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in an L2 learning context. Questionnaires were administered among 391 EFL learners to measure their trait EI, English learning-related negative emotion intensity, and the selection of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. The mediation analysis revealed that negative emotion intensity mediated the relationship between trait EI and cognitive reappraisal. However, the mediating effect of negative emotion intensity was not significant on the relationship between trait EI and expressive suppression. Semi-structured interviews revealed factors that explained the trait EI – negative emotion intensity – cognitive reappraisal nexus, including available cognitive resources and learning engagement. Pedagogical implications were provided to enhance the learners' selection of cognitive reappraisal and decrease their tendency to use expressive suppression.
