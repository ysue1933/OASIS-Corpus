The overarching objective of the World Language Professional Life Survey (WLPLS) was to determine the K–20 World Language (WL) profession's familiarity with both the World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages (5 Cs) and with the Can-Do Statements (Can-Dos). The survey strove to identify how both sets of principles might strengthen K–20 articulation in three ways: (1) WL teachers' level of formal training, (2) WL instructors' core beliefs about their pedagogical objectives, and (3) possible connections between their training and their core beliefs. The present study analyzes the findings from the survey. The researchers collected the data from the survey to determine what the relationships (if any) were between formal academic training and core pedagogical beliefs. The possible relationships check the pulse of WL professionals concerning their familiarity with the 5 Cs and the Can-Dos which can lead to stronger articulation.
