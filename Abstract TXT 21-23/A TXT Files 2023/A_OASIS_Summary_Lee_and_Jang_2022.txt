Growing interest in international teaching programs has produced a surge of research on international language teaching (Menard-Warwick, 2008). However, there are relatively few studies on the international teaching experiences of native English-speaking teachers of color regarding their racial identity. To fill this gap, this longitudinal multi-case study explores how three non-White novice native English-speaking teachers understood their racial and teacher identities during their international teaching in Korea. With a specific focus on their racial identity, how they make sense of their teaching and living experiences is examined in diverse contexts of their social interactions. The participantsâ€™ reflective and evaluative narratives from interviews were analyzed. The findings show that although their racial identity has a negative impact on their linguistic and professional identity that is denied by Korean society, the teachers utilized their own strategies for constructing a sense of belonging to the local and professional community. This study calls for a holistic, situated understanding of racial identity construction of non-White native English teachers by urging further discussion of racism in the global ELT profession. This discussion encompasses the varying, pressing needs of expatriate English teachers from diverse backgrounds.
