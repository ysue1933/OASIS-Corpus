Critical self-reflection, a process of self-examination and self-evaluation, facilitates introspective learning, which is a highly valued active learning technique and hence frequently employed in higher education. This paper reports on a cross-age fixed-role peer tutoring project where student tutors were required to reflect critically on their tutoring practices. Among several reflective efforts was writing a self-reflection at the end of each semester. 42 self-reflections over 3 semesters were collected. Qualitative analysis of the contents revealed multiple tensions and negotiations on this dynamic site of tutoring that contributed to the success or failure of a tutoring session. By presenting a preliminary framework of interrelated tensions and negotiations in the cross-age fixed-role peer consultations, this paper argues that peer tutoring is a collaborative and cooperative enterprise that is jointly owned and controlled by both the tutor and tutee. This study has theoretical and pedagogical implications for the design of and training for similar peer tutoring programmes in higher education.
