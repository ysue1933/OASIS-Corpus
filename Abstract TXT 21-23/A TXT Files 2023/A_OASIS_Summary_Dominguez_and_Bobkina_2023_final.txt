This article shares an innovative pedagogical experience that approaches diversity through cinema-based affective literacy practices in the EFL/ESL classroom. Following a social justice approach to education, we designed and implemented a workshop to develop affective literacy practices targeted at 49 pre-service teachers from the Master’s programme in EFL/ESL Teacher Training at the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain). Then, we analysed the experience’s results through semi-structured interviews with 20 teachers who volunteered to participate in the study. Our ultimate intention was to raise pre-service teachers’ awareness of teachers’ important responsibility as agents of positive social change (Katsiaficas 2020). The conclusions point to the success of the experience and unveil implications for future lines of work.
