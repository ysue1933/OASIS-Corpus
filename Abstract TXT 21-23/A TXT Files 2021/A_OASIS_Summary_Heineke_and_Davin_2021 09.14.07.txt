The Seal of Biliteracy (SoBL) is a language policy that has gained traction across the United States as stakeholders seek to recognize students’ competencies in languages other than English. Despite its potential to enhance language proficiency and encourage participation in language education, the SoBL has been unevenly implemented, with resulting inequities in whose bilingualism is recognized. With this study, we seek to understand implementational efforts in districts with established award programs that recognize large quantities of students. To reflect the national scope of the initiative, this multiple case study explores SoBL implementation in 6 districts spanning 5 states. Findings indicate that these high-awarding districts prioritize students’ home and heritage languages, as well as maintain flexibility and funding for language assessments; involve multiple stakeholders inside and outside of schools; and utilize related state policies to promote SoBL efforts. The study offers implications to enhance equity in SoBL policy, practice, and research.
