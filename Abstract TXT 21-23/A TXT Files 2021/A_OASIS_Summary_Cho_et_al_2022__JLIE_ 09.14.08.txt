The goals of this paper were to: (1) recognize the funds of identity that five emergent bilingual mother-child dyads express while making personal connections to culturally relevant books, (2) identify whether each dyad’s responses were convergent or divergent, and (3) explore how these discussions expanded participants’ views of one another or affirmed their shared identities. Each dyad video-recorded 9 book discussions (45 total). Then, each participant was interviewed. These data were coded using a combination of a priori and emergent coding, and frequency was counted for categories of coding. Findings show that culturally relevant books: (1) can be used as tools to recognize all categories of parents’ and children’s funds of identity, (2) served as tools to allow for comparison of how dyads’ funds of identity converged or diverged, and (3) resulted in parents and children expanding their views of one another and affirming their shared identities.
