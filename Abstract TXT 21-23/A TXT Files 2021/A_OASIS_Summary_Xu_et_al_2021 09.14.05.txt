Technology-enhanced character instruction has been frequently promoted in the past two decades but has been sparingly implemented. With emergency remote teaching as a catalyst for online instruction, Chinese language instructors may be more ready to adopt online technology and resources in character instruction in the future. In this mixed-methods study, we surveyed 133 Chinese language instructors at United States postsecondary institutions and conducted follow-up interviews. We explored instructors' perceived value of online tools in character instruction and their self-confidence in online character teaching. Further, adopting a technology acceptance perspective, we confirmed that perceived value, perceived students' readiness, and instructors' usage of online tools in emergency remote character teaching were determinants of instructorsâ€™ intention to integrate online tools in character instruction in the future.
