The study examined EFL instructors' perceptions of English textbooks. It also investigated whether the instructors' gender and the type of textbooks they used had a significant impact on their responses. A survey questionnaire with 30 closed-ended items was utilized to collect the data from 60 randomly selected EFL instructors who were teaching English in higher education institutions and English language centers. SPSS version 26.0 was used to analyze the data. The findings showed that the instructors had positive perceptions about English textbooks. They also believed that four skills of English were equally represented in the textbooks, and they contained adequate listening, speaking, reading and writing activities. In addition, the textbooks were enriched with the cultural issues of the target language and that they were appropriate for the Afghan context. The results also showed that textbooks served various roles in EFL classrooms, for instance, as a source of assessment and assignment. There were not statistically significant differences between female and male instructors' responses. However, the type of textbooks they used significantly impacted their perceptions of English textbooks. EFL Programs are recommended to encourage and support their instructors to use other English learning resources to optimize their studentsâ€™ learning.
