The increasing number of students with German as a second language (GL2) poses a great challenge for schools. Previous studies showed that especially young learners with a migration background are lagging behind in the acquisition of second language (L2) literacy. Experiencing problem behaviors (PB) in addition, might pose even greater challenges. Adequate vocabulary, including knowledge of additional vocabulary facts, is essential for appropriate L2 proficiency, and therefore, it is a crucial aspect of support that should be focused on. Thus, the aim of the study was to support vocabulary acquisition in students with GL2 regarding two aspects: (1) the acquisition of expressive and receptive vocabulary, and (2) the incidental acquisition of additional information regarding the vocabulary that are not explicitly focused on during intervention. To this end, the effectiveness of a multi-component method consisting of storytelling and flashcards, as well as motivational reinforcers, was examined using multiple baseline design. The intervention was carried out with nine primary school students with GL2 in three small groups three times a week for four weeks. The results indicated that the multi-component storytelling intervention was effective in increasing studentsâ€™ receptive and expressive vocabulary, as well as additional vocabulary facts in just one month. The article concludes with a critical discussion of the findings and generally provides pedagogical implications for schools on how to adequately support students with GL2 in their vocabulary acquisition.
