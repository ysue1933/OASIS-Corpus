The study reports pedagogical adaptations that Chinese language instructors made to support students' character learning during emergency remote teaching in 2020. Data from an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews show that the handwriting requirement in the language curriculum was modified to give way to technology-based instruction, making the conventionally isolated and solitary task of character learning more integrative and interactive. Beginning-level instructors' use of technology in character instruction was correlated with their self-confidence, perceived time sufficiency, technology access, and support received. Meanwhile, intermediate- and upper-level instructors' self-confidence and perceived values of online teaching were factors associated with their technology use. The crucial role of teacher communities in offering language-specific training and peer support is emphasized, and implications to the broader field of foreign language teaching are discussed.
