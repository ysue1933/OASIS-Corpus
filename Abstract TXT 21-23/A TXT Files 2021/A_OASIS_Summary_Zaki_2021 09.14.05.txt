Most research in corpus-based teaching has focused on using corpora in vocabulary building and the teaching of grammar. The present study discusses how corpus-based tasks can help to improve the writing skills of the learners of Arabic as a foreign language through inducing self-correction. The paper argues that a corpus-based approach allows learners the opportunity for self-correction and exploration of new ways to improve their sense of natural structures in Arabic. It presents a case study of intermediate level Arabic learners who complete corpus-based tasks designed based on their errors in written assignments. A combination of online and offline tasks were used, with the aim to actively engage learners in “thinking” about their errors and how to correct them.
