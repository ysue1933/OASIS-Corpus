State Seals of Biliteracy (SoBL) are a growing trend and present a promising method of serving an increasingly bilingual population. Currently, state SoBLs have been available almost exclusively at the high school level. An Oregon community college initiated the opportunity for students to study and receive the state SoBL in higher education. The expanded higher education option is important because many students miss the opportunity to receive the SoBL credential in high school. This article introduces background information, describes a model for bringing the state SoBL into higher education, presents preliminary findings, and recommends future work. The model could be replicated by other higher education institutions either wholly or in part to expand opportunities for this important state recognized credential and honor the assets of heritage language speakers. Although this article focuses on the SoBL in Spanish, the model could be tailored to the unique linguistic demographics in other regions.
