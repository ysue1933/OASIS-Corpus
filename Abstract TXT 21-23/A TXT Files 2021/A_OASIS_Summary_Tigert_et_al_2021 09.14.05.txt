Developing humanizing, culturally and linguistically responsive and justice-oriented classroom management practices require integrating robust theoretical principles with practice-based teaching experiences. Here, we explore how using Core Practices (CPs) as a foundation for reflecting on and enacting classroom management helped novice teachers (NTs) build humanizing pedagogies for organizing and managing classrooms populated by multilingual students. Using a participatory, dialogic research design, we draw on data from team meetings, teacher interviews, and classroom observations to describe how NTs reflected on and enacted the CP Building a Positive Learning Environment in their daily work and how it helped humanize their practice. Findings indicate that NTs positioned multilingual students as individuals with complex academic, social-emotional, linguistic, and behavioral strengths and needs; and enacted classroom management practices that were consistent, clear, culturally and linguistically responsive, and social-emotionally supportive. We discuss how CPs may help NTs attend to these aspects of classroom management for multilingual students and develop practices that are humanizing.
