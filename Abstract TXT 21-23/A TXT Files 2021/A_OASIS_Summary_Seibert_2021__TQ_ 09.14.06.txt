Previous methodological discussions in TESOL Quarterly (TQ) discuss imperatives for transparent and reflexive research practices and reporting (Derrick, 2016; Rabbidge, 2017). This article follows these methodological discussions by considering issues in second language (L2) and multilingual transcription by inspecting transcription and analyzing its reporting in empirical contributions to TQ. The study analyzes a series of transparency continuums with transcription reporting in TQ as they pertain to general transcription reporting and reporting that is particular to L2 and multilingual transcription. The article draws its argument from seminal scholarly discussions on transcription, calling for greater transparency with the transcription process in scholarly research reports.
