This study explored stance-taking in Chinese heritage language writing. Analysis focused on a prominent stance expression, wo juede ‘I think.’ Frequency, function, and formulaic usage of wo juede were compared across 3 written Chinese corpora by heritage learners, second language (L2) learners, and native speakers (L1 writers). The analysis revealed distinctive linguistic features and collocational patterns of stance-taking among the 3 groups. Overall, heritage writers’ stance performance was found to be self-centered and text oriented. They exhibited a strong reliance on wo juede combined with textual organizers such as contrastive or causal conjunctions. In contrast, L1 writers were more reader oriented, exhibiting a strong tendency to combine wo juede with interpersonal devices including attitudinal markers, modal verbs, sentence-final particles, and question forms. The study also found that heritage writers’ stance-taking performance consistently fell between that of L1 and L2 writers. Findings and pedagogical implications are discussed in light of heritage learner pragmatics and learner agency.
