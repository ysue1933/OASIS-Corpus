The complexity inherent in the TESOL field can present challenges for Language Teacher Associations (LTAs) in undertaking internal-facing roles such as professional learning including networking, conferences and publications, as well as external-facing roles such as advocacy work with stakeholders, and curriculum reform, among other issues (e.g., Elsheikh & Effiong, 2018b; Lamb, 2012; Paran, 2016). LTAs must be cognizant of and responsive to changing socio-political, policy, funding factors influencing TESOL provision, as well as the changing pedagogical needs of educators working across sectors. This study investigates the factors which influence and shape English as an Additional Language (EAL) education across a local (state based) EAL context and considers how these findings can inform the activities and practices of LTAs. Q methodology, which combines the use of qualitative and quantitative data, is employed to provide insights into current, deeply held perspectives of educators in relation to EAL provision. Findings provide insights into contextual variables which impact on EAL provision in adult education and school-based contexts, including intensive English education for refugee and migrant children. This in turn provides an opportunity to consider implications of these findings for LTA activities and practices, in particular, in relation to professional learning, leadership and advocacy.
