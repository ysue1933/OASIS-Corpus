This study investigated the relative effectiveness of immediate and delayed corrective feedback on the acquisition of -ing/-ed participial adjectives by Spanish English-as-a-foreign-language learners in video-based computer-mediated communication. Fifty-two participants took part in a communicative task in one of four groups (two experimental and two control). The immediate-feedback group received explicit corrective feedback during the task whereas the delayed-feedback group received the feedback 24 hours later by means of an edited video recording of the interaction. The effects of the feedback were measured through an oral production task and an untimed grammaticality judgment test. Although the results showed no differences between the two feedback timing groups and control participants on the grammaticality judgment test, both feedback groups outperformed the control group on the oral production task without showing statistically significant timing effects.
