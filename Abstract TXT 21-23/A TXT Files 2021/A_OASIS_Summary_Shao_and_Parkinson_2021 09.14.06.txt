Based on theories of emotion contagion and social appraisal in interpersonal affect transfer and the control-value theory of achievement emotions, the present study examined associations between students’ perceptions of peer emotions and their own self-perceived emotions in English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms. Data were collected from 103 seventh to ninth grade classrooms (n = 3,643) using self-report questionnaires. Doubly latent multilevel structural equation modeling showed that perceived peer enjoyment, anxiety and boredom, and students’ corresponding emotions for language learning, were positively related and that the effects of perceived peer enjoyment, anxiety and boredom on corresponding student emotions were mediated by control and value appraisals at the individual level. At the class level, however, the mediation effects were only significant for control appraisal as a mediator of effects on anxiety and value appraisal as a mediator of effects on boredom. Effects were robust across grade level, gender and previous language achievement. The discussion centers on the practical implications of peer emotion interactions for promoting foreign language development in classroom instruction.
