L2 (second/foreign language) motivation research in Finland has been scarce. Furthermore, international motivational research has focused more on ideal and ought-to selves, leaving the current L2 self-concept in the background. In the present study, we attempted to address this gap, exploring what shapes L1 (mother tongue) Finnish students' understanding of themselves as users and learners of L2s. Using structural equation modelling, we studied the relationships between students' (n = 1,206) current L2 self-concept and parental encouragement, peer pressure, societal expectations, and grades. We further studied which of these factors are the best predictors of students' current L2 self-concept. We explored these relationships separately for English and languages other than English (LOTEs). The analysis showed that while in both groups, students' grades and societal expectations shaped students' current L2 self-concept the most, other factors played a greater role in the LOTEs group than in the English group. We discuss these findings with reference to the teacher's role in shaping students' current L2 self-concept.
