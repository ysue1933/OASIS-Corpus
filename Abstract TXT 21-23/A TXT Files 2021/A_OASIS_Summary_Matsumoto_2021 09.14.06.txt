This study examines students’ self-initiated use of smartphones in multilingual writing classrooms in English-language programs at a U.S. university. Responding to calls for empirical research on materials use in second-language (L2) classrooms, researchers have focused on the roles of language learning and teaching materials in various L2 classroom contexts. Despite widespread access to smartphones among university students, how these students self-initiate use of smartphones for learning in L2 classrooms in noninterventional settings (cf. mobile-assisted language learning, which is often implemented for pedagogical purposes) has been under-researched. Employing linguistic ethnography along with a multimodal approach, this study examines moments (a) when L2 learners select smartphones as a relevant resource for learning and (b) when learner agency (e.g., Larsen–Freeman, 2019) and multiple involvements (i.e., simultaneously engaging in multiple activities and responsibilities as interlocutors; see Greer, 2016) become visible while students self-initiate smartphone use. It highlights how smartphones enable L2 learners to access diverse semiotic resources, maintain long turns by gazing at the devices, gain epistemic authority or primacy with those resources, resolve communicative problems, and change interactional dynamics.
