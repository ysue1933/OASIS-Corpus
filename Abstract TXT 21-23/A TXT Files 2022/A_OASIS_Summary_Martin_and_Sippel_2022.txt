This study investigated the relationship between learner beliefs about peer feedback and development of second language (L2) pronunciation skills after peer feedback on pronunciation had been used in the classroom. Seventy-four first-year learners of German were assigned to a peer feedback provider group, a peer feedback receiver group, and a control group. After completing a questionnaire designed to elicit learner beliefs about peer feedback, the provider group and the receiver group received general pronunciation training. Following the training, the provider group gave feedback to peers on their pronunciation and the receiver group listened to this feedback. Participantsâ€™ learning gains were measured by means of native speaker comprehensibility ratings of their productions both before and after the intervention. Statistical analyses revealed significant, positive relationships between learner beliefs about peer feedback and their learning gains. These results suggest that learners who held more positive beliefs about peer feedback tended to improve more after peer feedback had been implemented into their classroom. Pedagogical implications of these findings are discussed.
