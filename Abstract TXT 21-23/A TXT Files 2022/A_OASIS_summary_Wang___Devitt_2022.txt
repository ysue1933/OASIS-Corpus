The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated how ubiquitous and pervasive technology to support communication and collaboration has become in people’s lives. This article seeks to provide an overview of the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in learning Chinese as a foreign language (CFL). The authors systematically reviewed 68 empirical research articles and 3 review articles published between 2008 and 2022 (early April). This in-depth review aims to investigate: (1) the characteristics of CMC-facilitated CFL learning in the worldwide context; (2) common theoretical foundations and methodological approaches; (3) CFL learners’ linguistic and intercultural communicative competence development through CMC; (4) affordances and limitations of CMC in the field of CFL research. Findings from this review suggest that the majority of studies were in formal education contexts within Anglosphere countries. The most commonly acknowledged theoretical foundations in CFL were well aligned with the wider second language acquisition (SLA) domain. A mixed-methods approach was the predominant methodological approach undertaken in the selected papers, with a small number of experimental or quasi-experimental studies between 2008 and 2022. The analysis also identified a clear research gap in relation to young CFL learners in the literature. The predominance of studies at ab initio level would suggest that more research is needed on younger CFL learners and on intermediate and advanced CFL learners using CMC. Additionally, the synthesized affordances of applying CMC technologies in CFL practice from this review were: (1) active engagement; (2) authentic communication; (3) learner centeredness; and (4) opportunities for practice and discovery. By addressing technological and individual CMC implementation limitations in a CFL context, suggestions and recommendations about further research and teaching practice are highlighted in the conclusion section.
