A major challenge for Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) professionals is how to address the learning needs of diverse learners for whom a monolithic, native-normed version of English is no longer always useful or appropriate. Research in Global Englishes (GE) has noted many teachers' resistance to the adoption of a more “plurilithic” orientation. This study explores whether monolithic beliefs can be effectively challenged using practitioner role models. Video clips featuring early-career English teachers from Germany and China modeling a plurilithic orientation were played to pre-service teachers with the same L1 (“near peers”) or different L1s (“more distant peers”). Before viewing, participants responded to a questionnaire assessing their beliefs about English. Immediately following viewing, open-ended reactions to the video content were collected. One month later, participants answered the questionnaire again to measure potential changes in belief. After a further 5 months, a small group of participants were interviewed to explore impacts in greater depth. Data indicate that viewing the role models was a positive experience for most participants and was associated with significant increases in plurilithic orientation for near peers, with evidence of enduring impact for some. We interpret these results as support for the use of near peer video modeling as part of efforts to promote ontological clarity about GE in teacher education.
