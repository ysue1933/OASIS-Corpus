While research into various dimensions of language learning strategies has been thriving over the recent years, grammar learning strategies (GLS) have largely remained under-explored. The present mixed methods research aimed to explore GLS in the three stages of classroom grammar tasks, while striving to determine the sequence of GLS and their contribution to grammar proficiency. In the qualitative phase, 13 participants partook in stimulated recall and semi-structured interviews after completing consciousness-raising (CR) tasks. Then, the grounded theory (GT) methodology was applied to conceptualize a theoretical model. For the quantitative phase, a modified version of Pawlak’s Grammar Learning Strategy Inventory and a grammar proficiency test were administered to 249 participants. The theoretical model of GT indicated that learners set goals and expected an outcome in the ‘forethought’ phase. Then, they employed strategies to pay attention to the form or meaning of the grammatical feature. Learners also attempted self-instruction by using facilitators in the ‘performance’ phase. Furthermore, their self-evaluation played an essential role in the ‘self-reflection’ phase. The results also indicated an interplay between the forethought and self-reflection phases, whereas the interaction between the performance phase and the other two phases appeared to be unidirectional. Additionally, it was revealed that GLS in the forethought and self-reflection phases as well as ‘total grammar strategy use’ significantly predicted grammar proficiency. The findings will serve classroom pedagogy via contributing to the body of knowledge about strategy instruction in general and GLS in particular.
