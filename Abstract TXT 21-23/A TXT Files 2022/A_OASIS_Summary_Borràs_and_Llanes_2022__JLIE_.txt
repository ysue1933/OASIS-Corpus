Performing a stay in a country where the L2 is the official language can provide the perfect immersion for L2 development (traditional study abroad). In the case of English learners, internationalization and the role of English as a lingua franca make it unnecessary to perform the stay in an English-speaking country. Hence, an increasing number of students decide to study abroad in countries where English is used as a lingua franca (ELFSA). This study compares a group of Catalan/Spanish undergraduates learning English in a traditional study abroad setting (n = 31) to one doing so in ELFSA countries (n = 20) in order to examine differences concerning (a) reading comprehension and fluency, (b) receptive and productive vocabulary, and (c) L2 use. Participants were administered a reading text, the Updated Vocabulary Levels Test, a written task, and a questionnaire before and after their sojourns. Findings indicate that, subject to individual differences, both contexts provide similar outcomes in reading and vocabulary, and opportunities for L2 practice.
