This study investigated foreign language teachers’ beliefs about the research–pedagogy link by focusing on research-oriented universities. Participants (N = 107) held different roles at their universities: graduate students (n = 17), full-time second language (L2) instructors (n = 69), and language program directors (n = 21). Data were collected via a survey that asked about participants’ understanding and use of L2 research. Interview data were used to triangulate the survey results. The survey data were first subjected to exploratory factor analyses. ANOVAs were conducted for each extracted factor to compare the 3 roles. Multiple regression models were tested to identify predictors of participants’ beliefs. The factor analysis resulted in a 5-factor solution: (a) usefulness of research, (b) researchers’ engagement with teaching, (c) perceived institutional expectations, (d) engagement with research, and (e) trust in research and researchers. Instructors held different beliefs depending on their roles. Overall, program directors held more positive beliefs about L2 research than full-time L2 instructors, and full-time L2 instructors held more positive beliefs than graduate students. Regression models showed that L2 teaching qualification and L2 teacher training experience positively predicted participants’ engagement with research. Suggestions for improving the research–pedagogy relationship are discussed.
