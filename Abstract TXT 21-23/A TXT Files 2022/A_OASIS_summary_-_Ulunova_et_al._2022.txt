This study addressed the language in professional communication and national identity of civil servants-bilinguals in the Ukrainian border oblasts with Russia. It was empirically determined that the civil servants mainly use the Ukrainian language in professional communication with the users of civil services, but with colleagues, the Russian language. Most civil servants are proud of their nationality, but not all of them are clearly aware of their national identity. A statistically significant relationship between the valence of the national identity of the civil servants and oral and written professional communication in Ukrainian with the colleagues and users of civil services has been established. The clarity of the national identity of the civil servants is connected only with oral professional communication in Ukrainian with the colleagues and users of civil services. The parameters of male civil servantsâ€™ national identity is connected with a larger number of professional communication forms in Ukrainian.
