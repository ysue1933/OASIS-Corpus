This paper explores secondary school students’ investment in their language learning after having graduated from one of four bilingual (also termed Content and Language Integrated Language (CLIL)) primary school programs in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We show the different study pathways pursued by a selection of students and illustrate whether and how students continue with language learning from their bilingual primary program, how they may have invested in their language learning, and how this investment may have assisted with their identity development and related continuity with language study. Investment (individual and community) impacts upon learners’ identity development in the additional language, and thereby impacts choices made to continue or cease language learning when challenges are encountered in the progression of language learning across the year levels and as learners progress from primary to secondary school.
