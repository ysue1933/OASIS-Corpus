To test the predictive power of the SSARC (stabilize, simplify, automatize, reconstruct, and complexify) model of pedagogic task sequencing in second language (L2) writing development, the present study explores the performance of written decision-making tasks with varied levels of cognitive complexity in a simple-to-complex sequence in comparison to complex-to-simple and individual task performance sequences over time. The participants, 100 advanced-mid learners of English as a second language (ESL), who were divided into three groups completed writing tasks either (1) in a simple-to-complex sequence, (2) in a complex-to-simple sequence, or (3) at one level of complexity (i.e. simple, medium, or complex task versions). Their written production was analysed for syntactic complexity, accuracy, lexical complexity, and fluency (CALF). Quantitative analyses found that the simple-to-complex group produced more syntactically complex and accurate essays over time than the complex-to-simple group, although neither groupâ€™s progression was linear. When the two sequencing conditions were compared to the individual task performance condition, the results showed more improvement in CALF in both sequencing groups than in the individual performance group over time, with more and steadier growth in the simple-to-complex condition. These findings support the SSARC model and expand current understandings of the relationship between cognitive task complexity and L2 writing development under different task sequencing conditions, with implications for L2 writing pedagogy.
