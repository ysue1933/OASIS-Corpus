This study explored the impacts of a creative drama course on pre-service teachers’ beliefs about teaching skills. The participants kept weekly reflective journals and were observed in micro-teachings during the drama course. They were also interviewed four times over a period of two years. The results revealed positive perceptions about using drama in teacher education programs. Their beliefs were more oriented around personal and professional skills. As a result, performance-based practice embedded in creative drama courses in teacher education was discussed with a “teaching as a performing art” approach.
