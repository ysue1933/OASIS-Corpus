In recent years, research in multimodality has established the benefits of using multiple semiotic modes like image, sound, and text in digital second language (L2) communication. However, researchers have yet to investigate how L2 learners make meaning through embodied modes—or gestures and facial expressions. Grounded in the social semiotic theory of multimodality, this study leverages multimodal transcription and discourse analysis to describe how 126 college learners of L2 French used embodied modes in their video reflections. Findings reveal how gestures and facial expressions served to augment students’ metalinguistic awareness and organizational capacities in French. Further, embodied modes supported students in connecting to their audience. Because online language learning has increased during pandemic times, the findings shed light on the important role of embodied modes in designing L2 video assignments.
