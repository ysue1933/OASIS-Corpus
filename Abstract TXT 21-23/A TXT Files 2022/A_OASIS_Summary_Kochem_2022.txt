In recent years, research into the learning of pronunciation pedagogy and its effects on a teacher’s capacity to provide effective pronunciation instruction has been steadily growing. Nevertheless, a prominent puzzle piece still remains uncovered: the direct effect that coursework has on a trainee’s ability to deliver effective instruction. To address this gap, the current study explores the development of second language teacher cognitions and actual teaching practices in a tutoring project, which serves as the capstone assignment for a graduate course in pronunciation pedagogy. Semi-structured interviews, stimulated recalls, written reflections, and tutoring observations were used to explore the intricate connection between training and practices. Findings suggest that controlled activities made up the majority of the trainees’ techniques. Trainees requested more in-class practice with creating and conducting free activities, as these were viewed as the toughest technique. Also, this study found one predominant connection which the tutoring project brought to light: the trainees’ use of the communicative framework (Celce-Murcia, Brinton, Goodwin, & Griner, 2010) as an ‘order of operations’. These results highlight the importance of training in pronunciation pedagogy which includes a hands-on experience.
