Motivational factors have long attracted the attention of researchers and educators with their potential to shed light on what drives effective language learning. Although current research now views language learning motivation as a Complex Dynamic System (CDS), there is a dearth of empirical studies utilizing network analysis to understand how motivational systems operate. This exploratory study investigated the structure and connectivity of a second language (L2) motivational factor network, as well as its central relational links by using network analysis and graph visualizations. Findings suggest that L2 motivational factors rarely act alone and unique communities of L2 motivational factors can be identified. Furthermore, certain factors play a central role by connecting together a multitude of other factors and act as bridges between these communities. Learners' physical and emotional states, as initial conditions in the CDS, were key factors in tying communities together. The findings also indicate that motivating and demotivating factors do not only connect with factors of similar polarity (i.e., motivating or demotivating), they are also well-connected to each other, suggesting their interaction keeps the motivational system dynamic.
