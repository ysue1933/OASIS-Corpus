Myriad studies have been conducted to test the benefits of extensive reading (ER) on second language (L2) acquisition, while limited research has addressed or sought solutions to the unpopularity of ER in L2 classrooms, especially in secondary teaching contexts. With the aim of exploring both teachers’ and students’ perceptions and practice of ER, this study reports on two reading programmes carried out in Chinese secondary schools with variations in educational development, teacher training opportunities, and students’ overall competence. Data were collected from a student questionnaire survey (n = 86), two interviews with teacher participants (n = 2), and one interview with student participants (n = 9), teachers’ reflective journals, and various documents related to the reading programmes. Thematic analysis was adopted to analyse the qualitative data. A key finding of this study is that teachers’ scaffolding played a significant role in ER implementation. Without adequate teacher scaffolding, one reading programme only lasted for approximately two months. Based on the findings, scaffolded extensive reading (SER) is put forward and elucidated with its essential features. To provide some practical guidance for the implementation of SER in L2 classrooms, a three-stage model encompassing instructed ER, collaborative ER, and independent ER is presented and explicated to inform teachers in similar contexts.
