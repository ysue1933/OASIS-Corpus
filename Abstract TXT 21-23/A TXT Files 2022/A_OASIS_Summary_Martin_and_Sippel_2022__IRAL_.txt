This study investigated to what extent teacher and peer feedback promote L2 lexical stress perception skills and how gains are maintained over time. Eighty-two participants from 11 sections of first-year German courses at three universities were assigned to a teacher feedback group, a peer feedback provider group, a peer feedback receiver group, or a control group. After completing a pronunciation training on word stress in German–English cognates, the teacher group received feedback on their pronunciation from a teacher, the provider group gave feedback to peers, and the receiver group received feedback from peers. The control group did not complete the pronunciation training or receive feedback. Results comparing learners’ pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest perception accuracy revealed that the teacher group and the provider group made significant gains in terms of their ability to perceive word stress in cognates, whereas the receiver group and the control group showed no improvement.
