This study explores various forms of discrimination in providing basic education to the forcefully migrated Rohingya children currently living at the Kutupalong unregistered refugee camp, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The study employed an intersectionality theory to explore the barriers in offering basic education to Rohingya children. Applying a qualitative method, we interviewed 24 informants and administered 4 Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) to obtain more in-depth information about their experiences on providing basic education. This study reveals that lack of understanding of classroom instructions delivered in English and Burmese impede refugee children from obtaining the basics of learning instruction. The research, moreover, explores that neither the Bangladeshi curriculum nor Burmese education provided to the Rohingya children in the Learning Centers (L.C.s) leads them to any meaningful certification, which causes problems because it is not recognized in their country of origin. Apart from this, lack of teaching quality, teacher training, time allocation, insufficient international funding, and other logistical supports impede providing basic education among the children.
