This study investigated to what extent and how novice second-language (L2) Spanish learners use the cognitive linguistics-informed concept of boundedness to support their development of aspect—namely, the Spanish preterite and imperfect. The concept was presented within the framework of concept-based instruction (CBI) as part of a regular, semester-long U.S. college Spanish course for true beginners (N = 16). The sociocultural approach of CBI has been found to be effective for other complex L2 phenomena with more advanced learners, but the usefulness of the concept of boundedness for novice learners was untested. Definition, comprehension, verbalization, and performance data were triangulated to measure instructional effectiveness. Results suggest that the concept-based instructional approach using the concept of boundedness supported students’ understanding of aspect, evidenced by multiple measures of conceptual development, as well as their accuracy in using aspect to create personal narratives.
