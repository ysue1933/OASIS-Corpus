Since independence in 1975, Papua New Guinea, the most linguistically diverse country in the world, has had both unofficial and official policies of mother-tongue education. However, limited resources and support for mother-tongue education has led communities to incorporate bottom-up language planning as well. In particular, this paper examines the language planning efforts of the Kala Language Committee (KLC). The Kala language, which has four distinct dialects, is spoken in six villages in the Morobe province. In 2010, the KLC developed an orthography for their traditionally oral language leading to the expansion of mother-tongue education programmes in each of the six villages. Each village has different levels of language shift and during meetings in 2013 had developed their own individual language plans, which best suit their communityâ€™s needs. This paper compares the choices of each village to the wider choices of the KLC and to the demands of the national mother-tongue education policies.
