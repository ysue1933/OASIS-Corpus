This article contests the whitewashed ideologies and practices in teacher preparation programs and K–12 schools (Lee-Johnson, 2019) with a counter-storytelling analysis (Solorzano & Yosso, 2001, 2002). Based on the analysis of the lived experiences of two immigrant mothers of color (IMC), who had transitioned into certified English Language Learner (ELL) teachers, the researcher proposes a transformative frame, which stems from Crenshaw's (1989) intersectionality and Mezirow's (1990) transformative learning. The data sources include the two immigrant mothers' oral stories told at an ELL parent panel, their written teaching philosophy statements, and blog posts. The findings contribute to the knowledge base of teacher preparation in TESOL and applied linguistics by foregrounding the racially othered experiences of IMC; envisioning intersectionality as an agentive tool for negotiation, emancipation, and advocacy; and proposing a transformative frame for TESOL teacher education. The researcher calls for considerations of using intersectionality for transforming the teaching practices and ideologies in teacher preparation programs and K–12 schools.
