Second language (L2) writing research has demonstrated that young learners discuss linguistic issues, make use of feedback, and show a generally positive disposition toward writing tasks. However, many issues deserve further investigation. Regarding task implementation, few studies have been conducted with young learners writing individually, and few have compared different feedback types. Also, the focus of analysis has mostly been placed on students’ discussions; little is known about aspects such as draft quality and task motivation. To address these gaps, draft quality and task motivation were measured in 75 learners (aged 10–12 years) engaged in a three-stage writing task. They were divided into a task repetition group (n = 21), a group that received feedback via direct corrections (n = 30), and a group that received feedback via model texts (n = 24). Students’ drafts improved very slightly in complexity with task repetition; they significantly improved in accuracy with direct corrections, and also in lexical diversity and text quality with models. Task motivation remained high throughout the writing cycle in the task repetition group, where students found the task easy. However, it dropped slightly with direct corrections and – especially before the final draft, with models – which students deemed conducive to learning but difficult. Some pedagogical guidelines are discussed.
