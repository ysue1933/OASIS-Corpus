This study investigated L2 Korean speakersâ€™ self-assessment of speech comprehensibility and accentedness, including a conceptual replication of Trofimovich, Isaacs, Kennedy, Saito, and Crowther (2016, Experiment 1) and exploratory analyses of individual differences in self-assessment. L2 Korean speakers (N = 198) self-assessed their comprehensibility and accentedness using 9-point scales, rated their satisfaction with their pronunciation and the value (importance) of pronunciation on 9-point scales, completed a background questionnaire, and recorded a monologic speaking task. L1 Korean listeners (N = 82) judged 28 randomly assigned speakers for comprehensibility and accentedness using 9-point scales, and scores for each speaker were adjusted to account for variation in listener severity. Listener and self-assessments for both comprehensibility and accentedness correlated moderately (r = .54). Individuals with lower listener-based scores tended to overestimate their ability in self-assessment and vice versa, but higher listener-based scores were associated with smaller absolute miscalibration. Regression analyses suggested that pronunciation satisfaction and perceived value of pronunciation both influenced self-assessment scores and calibration.
