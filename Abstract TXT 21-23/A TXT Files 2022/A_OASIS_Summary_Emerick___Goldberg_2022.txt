In the policy context of college and career readiness, career and technical education (CTE) is growing in popularity, especially for students who are underserved in academic high school programs. While CTE has shown promise for some students, very little research exists on its potential for emergent bilingual students (EBs). Thus, building on research of deficit perceptions of EBs and language ideologies (LIs), this study examines how LIs and deficit perspectives are reproduced in CTE contexts across Pennsylvania. Using a sequential mixed-methods design, we found that, while CTE educators held generally positive attitudes toward EBs, they were influenced by monoglossic language ideology and standard language ideology. These LIs, along with other institutional factors, led educators to implement restrictive language policies within their classrooms. These implications serve to inform how, with a lack of clear language policy within CTE programs, teachers relied on their personal beliefs and reproduced deficit ideologies in the creation of classroom-level policies.
