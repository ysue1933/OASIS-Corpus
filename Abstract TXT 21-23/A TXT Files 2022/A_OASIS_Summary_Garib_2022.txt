English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in under-resourced contexts are prone to constraining factors influencing their interactive and technological pedagogical choices. To cast light on this population of EFL teachers' technology-integrated interactive teaching practices, such as technology-assisted project-based language learning (TAPBLL), this study examines EFL teachers' perceptions of TAPBLL before and after its implementation in Lebanon, Libya, and Syria. Survey and interview data were collected from 25 EFL teachers. The interviews were conducted via WebEx and Zoom between Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. The analysis of the data was guided by a phenomenological approach and the author identified themes from the participants' responses. The findings reveal that all teachers in the three contexts perceive TAPBLL as a desired teaching approach although they encountered a number of challenges when attempting to implement it. The findings provide implications for further research and teacher professional development.
