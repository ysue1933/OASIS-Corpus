# OASIS-Corpus

OASIS-Corpus is a library of cleaned texts of open accessible summaries from the Open Accessible Summaries in Language Studies (OASIS) and their corresponding abstracts.

## Constitution

629 summaries selected from OASIS + 629 corresponding abstracts

Criteria of selection:
- the language summary written in is English, 
- the year of publication is within the range from 2021 to 2023.

## Contribution

You are welcome to use the data in your research, mixups and (fun) projects â€” like I did with creating this corpus. You may find some code I have used in `code` and some analysis I have done in `myresult`.
