# OASIS-Corpus
Cleaned texts of open accessible summaries from the Open Accessible Summaries in Language Studies (OASIS) and their corresponding abstracts
You may find some code I have used in `code` and some analysis I have done in `myresult`.
You are welcome to use the data in your research, mixups and (fun) projects â€” like I did with creating this corpus.
