What this research was about and why it is important 
 Pedagogical materials like textbooks and teacher-created resources are foundational elements of language classrooms worldwide. Thus, how foreign language teachers and students actually use and interact with materials is critical for understanding how these influence language teaching and learning. However, ‘materials use’ in language classrooms has not been widely researched and is thus poorly understood. This qualitative case study of a French as a foreign language classroom examines materials use by focusing on influences and engagements among classroom objects (i.e., materials) and students/teacher. This approach is conceptualized as ‘pedagogical ergonomics,’ which centers on ‘materials-in-action.’ Key findings reveal four types of materials that affected patterns of classroom activity, and three different patterns of materials-in-interaction that link specific features of materials to the classroom discourse that they elicited. What the researcher did 
● Observed and recorded 13 class sessions involving 17 U.S.-based university students in a beginning-level French course and their European instructor over a 16-week semester, using audio-video equipment 
● Interviewed the students and teacher about their experiences with the materials used in class 
● All 13 hours of class and student teacher interviews were transcribed, and all pedagogical materials documented 
● Analyzed classroom activity and interaction that occurred with and around the pedagogical materials, by examining all classroom modalities (e.g., spoken language, bodily movement, text) 
● Conducted moment-to-moment ‘action analysis’ of classroom activity and interaction (e.g., physical, linguistic, social, and cognitive action) What the researcher found 
● ‘Materials use’ was empirically defined through the lens of pedagogical ergonomics as intra-actions among materials and students/teachers in classroom space 
● While sometimes difficult to quantify as discrete entities, dozens of different materials were used, most teacher-created 
● Taking a panoramic view of all of the materials used in the class, these were categorized into four different genres 
● The four genres included universal, communal, distributed, and responsive materials, which were based on (a) their different design features, (b) the organization of their contents, (c) how students engaged with each type of material, and (d) how students engaged with each other and the teacher when using the material 
● Additionally, in-depth analyses focused on three moment-to-moment patterns of ‘materials-in-action,’ examining how particular examples and detailed features of materials induced different types of classroom activity and interaction 
● These three in-depth analyses included (a) a controlled task where students’ utterances ‘mapped’ onto a worksheet, (b) two simple images of houses that students described by generating spontaneous spoken French and focusing on unfolding meaning-making, and (c) a dynamic game-like activity where learners matched sentences on paper strips 
Things to consider
 
● Somewhat paradoxically, materials influenced classroom activity and interaction in unpredictable and systematic ways 
● Unexpected and complex outcomes of foreign language teaching materials illustrate that a usage-based research approach is critical to understanding materials in relation to language pedagogy 
● Some of the simplest materials effectively elicited the most French from students while more designedly complicated materials did not. Future research in other contexts is needed to clarify and expand on this qualitative case study 
● Findings have concrete practical implications for foreign and second language educators 
● The framework of pedagogical ergonomics that is proposed and developed in this article may be useful to future research focused on materials-in-use, not only within language education but in education research more broadly 
● Many of the materials used and studied in this foreign language classroom likely resemble other foreign and second language classrooms worldwide
