What this research was about and why it is important 
 One important aspect of acquiring communicative competence, or the ability to communicate effectively in a language, is gaining the ability to vary across linguistic forms in an appropriate manner based on features of the social and linguistic context. This ability, called sociolinguistic competence, is important for not only native speakers of a language, but second-language learners as well. One such sociolinguistic feature of Spanish is /s/-weakening in which the /s/ is physically weakened and becomes either aspirated—similar to the English /h/—or completely deleted. A weakened /s/ form is not considered standard and the acquisition of this form poses several challenges for learners given that its use depends on a variety of linguistic and social factors (e.g., social class, speaker origin, rate of speech, etc.). However, extended exposure to sociolinguistic variables increases the chances that students will employ them in a native-like way. Hence, the current study seeks to determine if second-language learners of Spanish who are exposed to /s/-weakening during a semester-long study abroad begin to employ /s/-weakening in their own speech. Our results show that despite extensive exposure to this feature, in general, learners do not adopt this feature into their speech. However, a fine-grained analysis of the acoustic features of the /s/ tokens produced by the learners demonstrate that they are headed in the direction of their native-speaker counterparts with regard to /s/-weakening. 
What the researchers did
 
● Participants: 22 native English speakers, enrolled in a semester-long study abroad program in either Santiago, Dominican Republic or Madrid, Spain; 21 native speakers of Spanish from the study abroad regions. 
● Participants completed three tasks (before and after study abroad for the learners): Grammar test in Spanish - a cloze test in which students completed a narration by selecting the correct grammar form from three options; Background questionnaire - Including questions regarding the students’ demographics, experience with languages other than English, use of Spanish, language attitudes, and awareness of dialectal features; Semi-guided interview - participants were interviewed and produced spontaneous speech from which the /s/ tokens were extracted for the analysis. 
● Tokens of /s/ were analyzed categorically and continuously: o Categorical analysis - The tokens of /s/ were placed into one of three categories from auditory review and visual inspection of the waveform and the spectrogram in the program Praat; o Continuous analysis - The percentage of voicelessness of each /s/ token was extracted from Praat’s Voice Report. The COG (center of gravity) of /s/ for each token was also obtained. Finally, we measured the duration of /s/ in milliseconds from the beginning to the end of each instance of /s/. 
What the researchers found
 
● Learners showed no meaningful increase in /s/-weakening, as they almost always articulated a full /s/ at the beginning and end of the semester abroad. 
● Leaners did become more native-like with respect to /s/-voicing and duration in their speech. 
● Learners did not gain sensitivity to all factors that constrain /s/-weakening during their study abroad experience. 
Things to consider
 
● The students’ exposure to /s/-weakening in the host communities, particularly in the Dominican Republic, was very frequent. However, one semester may not be enough for students at this stage in their L2 development. 
● Further research can investigate why learners exhibit the use of some but not all regional features in their speech after being exposed to those features while abroad. 
● It is hypothesized that the inherent complexity of variable /s/-weakening, which also diverges from the L2 learners’ L1 English sound system, is too difficult cognitively for L2 learners at this stage in their acquisition to integrate into their developing L2 system. 
● While students may perceive /s/-weakening and have positive conscious attitudes toward this dialect feature, it does not always lead to the adoption of the feature.
