What this research was about and why it is important 
 Learning the different parts of speech of a word is important for learners of English to expand their vocabulary knowledge and to use words grammatically accurately. However, the number of derivatives (e.g., happy, unhappy, happiness) second language (L2) learners should know productively is unclear. The study investigated to what extent first language (L1) speakers and L2 learners with differing vocabulary levels could produce derivatives, and to what degree their productive knowledge of derivatives differed. The results of the study indicated that productive knowledge of derivatives is challenging to fully develop even for first language (L1) speakers, and that the ability to produce derivatives differed considerably among L2 learners with differing vocabulary levels.  
What the researchers did
 
● 23 L1 English speakers and 107 L2 English learners participated in the study. The L2 learners’ knowledge of the meanings of the 1000–5000 (word family frequency) word levels varied, ranging from no level mastered, mastering the 1000 level, the 2000 level, and the 3000–5000 levels. 
● This study used a derivative form recall test which asked participants to produce different derived forms of 90 prompt words chosen from different word family frequency levels (1000, 2000, 3000–5000). The test was scored for how many total derivatives were produced (Scoring Method 1), and in how many instances at least one derivative was produced for a part of speech (nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs) (Scoring Method 2). For example, if participants produced happiness (n), unhappiness (n), happy (adj), unhappy (adj), and happily (adv) for happy, they were awarded 5 points under Scoring Method 1, and 3 points under Scoring Method 2. 
What the researchers found
 
● Under Scoring Method 1, L1 speakers and L2 learners produced on average 40% and 25% of all derivatives that could have been produced for the prompt words. Under Scoring Method 2, L1 speakers and L2 learners produced at least one derivative for each part of speech of the prompt words on average 71% and 47% of the instances. 
● L2 learners’ rates of successful production of derivatives differed by their vocabulary levels. Under Scoring Method 1, L2 learners who had mastered the 3000–5000, the 2000, the 1000 level, and those that had not mastered any levels produced on average 34%, 27%, 24%, and 18% of all derivatives. Under Scoring Method 2, L2 learners who had mastered the 3000–5000, the 2000, the 1000 level, and those that had not mastered any levels provided at least one derivative for on average 62%, 51%, 45%, and 35% of the instances. 
● When L1 speakers and L2 learners’ responses in the derivative form recall test were compared, the results revealed that L1 speakers produced a greater number of derivatives than most of the L2 learners, but they did not outperform learners mastering the 3000–5000 levels in Scoring Methods 1 and 2. 
Things to consider
 The findings of this study offer several takeaways for how productive knowledge of derivatives should be taught, practiced, and assessed.  
● The results indicated that L1 speakers should not be expected to be able to produce all derivatives of a word. Therefore, in aiming to develop L2 learners’ productive knowledge of derivatives, teachers should consider selecting derivatives that are useful for a specific group of learners. 
● The results of L2 learners with differing levels of vocabulary suggest that vocabulary levels could be indicative of the degree to which learners can produce derivatives. Therefore, it would be useful to measure learners’ vocabulary levels before deciding on appropriate approaches to teaching derivatives.  
● The results of L1 and L2 learners suggest that producing derivatives out of context can be challenging. In future research it would be useful to compare L1 and L2 learners’ performance on both contextualized and decontextualized derivative form recall tests.
