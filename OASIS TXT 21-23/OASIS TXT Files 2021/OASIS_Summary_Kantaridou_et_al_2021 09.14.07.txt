What this research was about and why it is important 
  Motivation for long-term language learning is a complex and dynamic concept. English as an international language has evoked both instrumentality promotion (seeking success with clear goals) and instrumentality prevention (avoiding negative consequences) motivations in learners. Being able to identify types/clusters of learners in tertiary level students (just before entering the job market) becomes crucial for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instructors. This study identifies such clusters of learners based on the second language (L2) Motivational Self System theory. The cluster that combines both promotion and prevention aspects in language learning motivation are more at risk to loss their advanced level of competence. 
What the researchers did
 
● The participants were 359 Greek EAP university students (aged 19-20 years) pursuing studies within the economic discipline. About half of them (42.9%) could speak one (or more) additional foreign language (L3). 
● The level of General English language competence was measured in relation to the language certificates the students reported to hold (according to CEFR: B2=51.8%). Their Academic English competence (valid assessment of the students’ current competence) was assessed with the TOEFL ITP test (B-level=68.8%, C-level=30.9%). The comparison of the two measurements indicated a discrepancy between the perceived (past) and current performance. 
● The questionnaire included four scales: ideal L2 self (what you aspire to become), ought-to self (what the socioeducational context expects you to become), instrumentality promotion and instrumentality prevention. It also asked the importance of English for employment, the students’ future educational and career goals, their determination to complete their studies and parental educational attainment (English as a Foreign Language (EFL) knowledge and family residence). 
What the researchers found
 Three distinct motivational clusters were revealed: 
● Cluster 1 students [+++ideal, +ought, ++ promotion, +prevention] were the most motivated (+ is the weakest, +++ is the strongest). They sustained their advanced level of English, spoke an L3, felt highly confident that they would continue with postgraduate studies abroad, were brought up in urban, metropolitan cities and they had the highest percentage of parents with postgraduate degrees and good EFL knowledge. 
● Cluster 2 [+ideal, ++ought, +promotion, ++prevention] were the least motivated: intermediate level in English, fewer L3 speakers, with the lowest determination to complete their studies and coming from regional place of residence. 
● Cluster 3 [++ideal, +++ought, +++promotion, +++prevention] were the ‘overstrivers’ indicating higher promotion and prevention characteristics. More than half of the participants belonged to this cluster. Similar characteristics to cluster 1.  
Things to consider
 
● Higher ideal L2 self seems to contribute to higher proficiency levels (clusters 1 and 3) while prevention instrumentality seems to detract from sustenance of language competence (cluster 3). Higher educational level of the parents may enhance the learners’ ideal L2 self and shape their future identity. 
● If language learning is promotion framed, it seems to become appealing to learners of all clusters. Additional combination with a prevention framing in the form of parental pressure to acquire advanced language certificates (clusters 2 and 3) tends to erode interest in language learning once the goal is achieved. 
● EAP instructors may wish to identify students with high promotion and prevention instrumentality to train them in eager risk-taking (rather than avoidance) strategies to maximize opportunities for communication in L2 to sustain competence levels.
