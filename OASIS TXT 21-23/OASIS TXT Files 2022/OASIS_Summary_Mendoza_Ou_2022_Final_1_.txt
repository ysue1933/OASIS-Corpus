What this research was about and why it is important 
 English-medium instruction (EMI), teaching academic subjects in English to students for whom English is an additional language, is a global phenomenon. Bi/multilingual communication naturally flows in an EMI class regardless of language policy, and teachers are aware that this language use facilitates teaching and learning, classroom management, and linguistically inclusive spaces. Therefore, we developed the first comprehensive inventory of bi/multilingual practices in EMI as a freely downloadable, expert-reviewed, pilot-tested survey and semi-structured interview protocol (the CACTI) for teachers and schools worldwide to reflect on how they use bi/multilingual practices in EMI—and for researchers to study how they do so in different settings. In this paper, we outline the development and use of the instrument. 
What the researchers did
 
● Created an instrument based on a thorough survey of the literature on bi/multilingual practices in EMI, as an expert-reviewed and pilot tested survey and interview protocol 
● Analyzed quantitative and qualitative data from EMI teachers in Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China with deductive and inductive coding 
● Demonstrated generalizability by linking the findings to peer-reviewed empirical research, qualitative and quantitative, in Europe and internationally 
What the researchers found
 
● Most bi/multilingual practices (24 out of 30), mainly related to teaching and learning, were approved to a moderate degree, balancing immersion with bi/multilingual mediation 
● One practice—combining multimodality and multilingualism as a resource for learning the curriculum—was the most widely approved and uncontroversial, yet this may not extend to alternative literacies and funds of knowledge beyond the curriculum 
● Five practices were controversial, related to (1) choosing language forms with agency and not just appropriateness, (2) language-mixing in academic and not just social discourse, (3) validating minoritized as well as majoritized bi/multilingualism in society, (4) investigating language use and language ideologies in the media and in public spaces, and (5) examining the unequal value placed on different languages in society 
Things to consider
 
● To optimize use of time and resources, teacher professional development and teacher empowerment should be targeted towards areas that are controversial.
