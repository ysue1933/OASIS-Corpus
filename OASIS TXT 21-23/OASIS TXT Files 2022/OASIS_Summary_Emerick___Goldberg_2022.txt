What this research was about and why it is important 
 Language ideologies, which are often unexamined beliefs about language and language learning, have a profound influence on the opportunities that emergent bilingual youth receive in U.S. schools. The pervasive negative perceptions of emergent bilinguals and associated limited opportunities have pushed researchers to consider alternative educational opportunities, such as career and technical education (CTE). At the present time, however, there are nearly no studies on language ideologies or emergent bilinguals in CTE programs. This study focused on examining teachers’ language ideologies in CTE programs in Pennsylvania, United States. We collected survey data and interviews with CTE teachers in order to answer the following research questions: What is the relationship between CTE educators’ beliefs about emergent bilinguals and language ideologies? And how do CTE educators’ language ideologies and beliefs about emergent bilinguals inform school-level education and language policies? Based on the data, we argued that high levels of belief that there is only one correct form of language (i.e., standard language ideology) and that in the United States people should speak English (i.e., monoglossic language ideology) were associated with negative views of emergent bilingual students. We also found that high levels of belief in these two language ideologies related to two important factors that could affect EBs’ opportunity to learn: (a) the belief that teachers should restrict students’ language use in schools and (b) the belief that schools should have policies that require students to use English. 
What the researchers did
 
● Conducted a 72-item online questionnaire with 167 responses 
● Interviewed 12 CTE teachers from 10 different CTE schools in Pennsylvania 
● Conducted statistical analyses based on hypothesized outcomes from the questionnaire data 
● Analyzed the interview data, wrote analytic memos, identified patterns in the qualitative data and constructed theme 
● Collaboratively wrote and critiqued analytic memos where we integrated qualitative and quantitative data 
What the researchers found
 
● Restrictive language ideologies (e.g., the belief that people in the United States should be made to speak English and that there is only one correct form of English) were associated with the belief that emergent bilingual students’ lacked the ability to succeed in CTE programs, to attain college and career readiness, and did not deserve the same opportunities as their native-English-speaking peers 
● Interview data suggested that participants with lower investment in restrictive language ideologies held positive views of emergent bilingual students and felt that they brought rich cultural knowledge and language skills to class 
● There was some evidence that participants who strongly held restrictive language ideologies acted upon these beliefs systems in class by deliberately creating barriers for bilingual students to communicate in languages other than English 
● There were conflicting views of whether CTE programs provided good opportunities for emergent bilingual students, with some participants suggesting there is a pervasive assumption that CTE programs are universally good for emergent bilingual students 
Things to consider
 
● Deficit beliefs about emergent bilingual students seem to be pervasive in CTE programs, which could negatively impact students access to opportunities in CTE 
● Because of a lack of institutional policies in CTE affirming the language rights of bilingual students, teachers drew on their personal belief systems to create de facto language policies. CTE programs should consider adopting affirmative language policies to avoid educational inequities resulting from restricted language use
