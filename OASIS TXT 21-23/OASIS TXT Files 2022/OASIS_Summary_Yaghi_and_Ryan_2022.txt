What this research is about and why it is important English language classes often bring together students from a wide range of cultural backgrounds and walks of life. While this diversity is a source of pride, students often arrive bearing animosities and prejudices towards particular groups and this poses a threat to classroom harmony and to individual well-being. Reflecting wider social and political trends, a frequent target may be students who are visibly Muslim, particularly women. This study analyzed stories, recounted by Saudi women, of their experiences with Islamophobia in classroom interactions and identified ways in which they were targeted. Incidents involved a range of interpersonal behaviors (e.g., associations with terrorism) and often included reference to an underlying belief (e.g., ‘Muslim men are violent’). 
What the researchers did
 
● 12 Saudi women were interviewed two or three times each over the course of their study in New Zealand 
● Stories of classroom-based incidents of Islamophobia were identified within the interview transcripts 
● The verbal and physical actions that make up the story were identified (e.g., ignoring, complimenting) 
● These actions were analyzed from the perspective of 1) why they were worth mentioning, and 2) how they were described 
● Each story was then analyzed for what it reveals about underlying perceptions of Muslims 
What the researchers found
 
● Nearly all the women had multiple stories about encountering Islamophobia 
● The aggressors typically invoked underlying beliefs about Muslims being violent, threatening, and misogynistic 
● Their behavior towards the women ranged from persistent microaggressions to very direct and open hostility 
● A frequently used technique was ‘interrogation’, in which the women were bombarded with inappropriate, leading, and highly personal questions (e.g., ‘Does your husband hit you?’), while sincere answers were dismissed in pursuit of an assumed ‘truth’ about the lives of Muslim women 
● More hostile incidents included direct insults, inappropriate jokes (e.g., accusations of terrorism), and statements such as ‘I don’t like you Saudi women’ 
● These incidents tended to occur in teacher-arranged groupwork activities 
Things to consider
 
● Adult language teaching classrooms are often highly complex interpersonal environments, with teachers often remaining unaware of the tensions that exist between students and the underlying prejudices that stoke these tensions 
● Islamophobia may be particularly toxic within the present global climate of increasing neo-nationalism 
● However, there has been very little previous consideration of Islamophobia in language teaching contexts 
● Islamophobia is enacted in the classroom in ways that range from the subtle (e.g., persistent interrogation) to the overtly aggressive 
● Teachers and teacher trainers can learn to recognize these enactments, understand how they work, and decide how to respond 
● The most hostile incidents occurred when teachers assigned students to work together in groups; why is this and how should teachers counter this?
