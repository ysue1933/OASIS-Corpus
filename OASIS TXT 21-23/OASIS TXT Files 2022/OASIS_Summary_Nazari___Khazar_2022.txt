What this research was about and why it is important 
 In recent years, research has significantly explored the role of emotions in learners’ and teachers’ educational practice. As a strand of research on language teacher emotions, emotion labor (i.e., the clash between internal feelings and external expectations) has appeared in the interface between personal and power-related discourses. However, little research has examined this issue in relation to assessment and how it can function as a source of emotion labor. This study explored that issue in relation to Iranian English language teachers. The study is important because it lies in the multidisciplinary space of English language teaching, emotion labor, and assessment. Moreover, it clarifies how these factors integrate to (re)shape teachers’ professional practice. 
What the researchers did
 
● We collected data from 13 Iranian English language teachers in a top-down context (i.e., one that follows dictated policies) 
● We collected data through narrative frames and semi-structured interviews 
● We sought how emotions feature as discourse in the top-down context 
● We sought how teachers show agency to resist the top-down context 
What the researchers found
 
● We found that the institutional system constrains the teachers’ agency profoundly 
● Teachers show resilience in practicing their preferred assessment methods by implementing techniques that prioritize learners’ needs over institutional demands 
● Teachers argued for more attention to teachers’ assessment-related emotion labor, especially at a discursive level 
● Although the system constrained the teachers, they practiced assessment because they were motivated to do so 
Things to consider
 
● There should be more partnership between teachers and policymakers to account for teachers’ emotion labor 
● Teachers should show agency tactfully so that their professional practice is not jeopardized 
● Policymakers need to constantly revisit the policies to respond to teachers’ needs 
● School supervisors should open more room for teachers’ agency and emotion-related perceptions about how to work institutionally
