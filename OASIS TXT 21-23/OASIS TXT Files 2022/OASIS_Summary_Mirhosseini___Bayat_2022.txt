What this research was about and why it is important 
 Critical approaches to language education have redefined teacher roles as sociocultural and ideological engagements, but language teachers’ own understanding of their position within the ideological contestations surrounding language teaching is not widely investigated. Understanding teachers’ views of their sociocultural responsibilities beyond teaching communicative skills can provide in-depth insight into possibilities for critical language education. Moreover, examining how these views are created in the process of becoming teachers can be significant in critical language teacher education praxis. In this paper we present a narrative study of three teachers’ perspectives, specifically addressing the following questions about them: Do they assume sociocultural responsibilities for themselves as English language teachers, and if so, how? How are their perspectives in this regard shaped through their journeys of becoming a teacher? Considering their different trajectories of shaping conceptions of language teachers’ sociocultural roles, we argue that critical sociocultural views still play a marginal role in actual teacher preparation processes and that the field needs to further embrace critical approaches to language teacher education. 
What the researchers did
 
● We invited three teachers of English teaching at private language institutes where they learned English themselves and passed their initial teacher preparation stages 
● We interviewed them in multiple narrative interview sessions in which they shared their memories and stories of becoming an English teacher in their own voice 
● We encouraged the participants to tell their detailed stories starting from their language learning years through their formal teacher preparation experiences and early stages of teaching 
● We transcribed and read their narratives and re-constructed them as overall meaningful stories of becoming teachers that were considered to address our research questions 
What the researchers found
 
● Our narrative analysis of the three teachers’ extended stories portrayed a detailed image of their different journeys of becoming an English language teacher 
● It appeared that their conceptions of their own sociocultural roles were shaped through years of being language learners, student teachers, and beginner teachers 
● The participants portrayed three different attitudes in relation to their understanding of their teaching roles: skillsbased, ambivalent, and critical 
● They appeared to rely on observations of their own language teachers in interpreting their later experiences and used them as a lens to view those experiences 
● Their formal teacher preparation stage did not seem to transform their already existing mentalities about the sociocultural role of an English teacher 
Things to consider
 
● At least in the context of this study, but possibly in other contexts as well, critical sociocultural views appear to be far from becoming a strong aspect of English language education 
● Teachers’ perceptions and abilities – including their views of the sociocultural significance of their roles – are not simply shaped through teacher education programs 
● Language teachers’ own learning experiences do play a role in shaping their character as a teacher but not as a mere list of what to do/avoid in terms of teaching techniques 
● Teacher preparation programs should provide a space of learning and unlearning in which student teachers can rethink the discourses that they have absorbed or been created by 
● Language teacher educators should include more critical elements in teacher education courses and activities regardless of their length and scope 
● Prospective and current teachers can put exploring and adopting critical perspectives and practices on their personal agenda of becoming/being English teachers
